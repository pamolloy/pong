Project:    a video game based on pong

Purpose:
    A simple one-person ping-pong game.

System Interface:
    An ncurses interface which creates data structures known as windows.
    A default window called stdscr, which is the size of the temrinal
    screen is supplied.

    - The random number function to determine what speed to serve the ball
    - Each time the ball bounces of the paddle, the speed of the ball is
        changed by a small, random, amount

    Signals are managed with sigaction, which provides a substantial
    improvement over the signal system call. Ideally this would be
    handled with select.

Screen Management:
    - The size of the court depends on the size of the terminal
    - The court must be surrounded by a three character wide border on
        all sides
    - The size of the paddle should be about one third the size
        of the court
    - The paddle must always stay within one column
    - The paddle may not leave the court
    - The ball is served from the middle of the court
    - If the ball gets past the paddle the ball is out of play
    - Display the time and balls remaining

Program Flow:
    - Initialize the ncurses library
    - Create and display the court, paddle and ball
    - ...

Bugs:
    - Inadequate error handling
    - Game time is not displayed on the scoreboard
    - Tabs may be used instead of spaces in some parts of the source code
