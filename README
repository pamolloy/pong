NAME
    pong - a Unix version of pong

SYNOPSIS
    This is a one-person ping-pong game. The object of the game is to
    keep the ball (i.e. `O') in play as long as possible using the
    paddle (i.e. a line of `#').

    Move the paddle up and down the screen, one row at a time, by
    pressing the 'k' and 'm' keys, respectively.

    After three balls are out of play the game is over.

    Press the `Q' key to quit the game.

BUILD
    Install curses (e.g. `aptitude install lib32ncurses5') and then run `make'.
